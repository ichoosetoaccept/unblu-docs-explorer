# Building MCP with LLMs

This guide explains how to use Large Language Models (LLMs) like Claude to accelerate MCP development.

## Preparation

1. Gather Documentation:
- Full MCP documentation from modelcontextprotocol.io/llms-full.txt
- MCP TypeScript or Python SDK README files
- Relevant API documentation

2. Server Specification:
Define clearly:
- Resources to expose
- Tools to provide
- Required prompts
- External system integrations

## Development Process

1. Core Implementation:
- Start with basic functionality
- Iterate to add features
- Get explanations for unclear parts
- Test and handle edge cases

2. Key MCP Features:
- Resource management
- Tool definitions
- Prompt templates
- Error handling
- Connection setup

## Best Practices

1. Development Strategy:
- Break down complex servers
- Test components individually
- Validate inputs
- Maintain security
- Document thoroughly

2. Testing:
- Review generated code carefully
- Use MCP Inspector for testing
- Test with Claude.app
- Iterate based on usage

## Ongoing Development

- Modify and improve based on requirements
- Implement new features as needed
- Maintain documentation
- Monitor performance
